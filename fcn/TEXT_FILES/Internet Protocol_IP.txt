What is the Internet Protocol (IP)?
1) The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. 
2) Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place.
3) Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are TCP and UDP.

What is an IP packet?
IP packets are created by adding an IP header to each packet of data before it is sent on its way. An IP header is just a series of bits (ones and zeros), and it records several pieces of information about the packet, including the sending and receiving IP address.

What is UDP/IP?
The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is another widely used transport protocol. It's faster than TCP, but it is also less reliable. UDP does not make sure all packets are delivered and in order, and it doesn't establish a connection before beginning or receiving transmissions.
