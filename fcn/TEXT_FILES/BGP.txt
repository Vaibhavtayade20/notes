Border Gateway Protocol:-

1) It is an interdomain routing protocol, and it uses the path-vector routing.
2) It is a gateway protocol that is used to exchange routing information among the autonomous system on the internet.
3) Border Gateway Protocol works on different autonomous systems.
4) An autonomous system is a collection of networks that comes under the single common administrative domain.
5) The BGP is the only protocol that is running on the internet backbone or used to exchange the routes between two different autonomous number systems.
6) IBGP (Internal BGP): If all the routers are neighbors of each other and belong to the same autonomous number system, the routers are referred to as an IBGP.
7) EBGP (External BGP): If all the routers are neighbors of each other and they belong to the different autonomous number systems, then the routers are referred to as an EBGP.
